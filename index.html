                        Amtrak is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Amtrak operates on a wide network
                        covering 46 states of the United States with 500 destinations. It is the only high-speed intercity passenger rail
                        carrier in the United States, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 mph (241 kph). Amtrak
                        customers make roughly 46,200 journeys every day on average. As per the data(2012) given in the table, the busiest
                        station with highest number of passengers is <span id="newYorkPenn" class="textRef">New York (Penn Station)</span>, New York and 
                        <span id="phily30" class="textRef">Philadelphia (30th St)</span>, 
                        Pennsylvania respectively. Amtrak trains travel on tracks that belong to other railways for 75% of their journey. 
                        "Host railways" include big, publicly listed firms based in the United States or Canada, as well as state and local
                        government organizations and small businesses.

                        The majority of Amtrak stations are located in higher areas. The station located at the highest
                        elevation is Frisco, Colorado with <span id="elevation" class="textRef">9070</span>ft. Amtrak continued to upgrade important station
                        facilities on the NEC in FY 2020 for better operations and a better customer experience. In many locations                      
                        where intercity bus and plane service are unavailable, Amtrak is the only intercity passenger
                        transit option. Amtrak employs almost 21,000 employees from 46 different states, with a total
                        annual payroll of more than $1.6 billion. Fort Worth, Texas is a central station and is
                        famous for its soaring clock tower. The train route between New York, N.Y. (Penn Station)
                        and Montreal (Gare Centrale), Quebec is the most scenic Amtrak route.

                        According to the data(2012) given in the table, Columbia, South Carolina is the only station
                        that handles US Mail service. There are <span id="dlsave" class="textRef">20</span> Amtrak stations that does not observe any Day light savings. 35 Amtrak

                        and the rest don’t have a ticket office. Amtrak stations have different time zones. There are <span id="cst" class="textRef">186</span> stations following Central Time Zone
                        (CST), <span id="est" class="textRef">339</span> stations following Eastern Time Zone (EST), <span id="mst" class="textRef">63</span> stations following Mountain time, and

                        Amtrak Express trains. The Texas Eagle is Amtrak's longest (and oddly presidential) route,
                        running between Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California.

                        Almost all Amtrak stations are equipped with an enclosed waiting area, Wi-Fi, parking area, accessible platform, 
                        and wheelchair facilities. There is no inter-city passenger rail service to the states of South Dakota or
                        Wyoming. <span id="kansas" class="textRef">Kansas City, Missouri</span> is a popular Amtrak station featuring its Beaux Arts glory, a
                        planetarium and a rail history exhibit with main hall containing 3,500-pound chandeliers hanging
                        overhead. Washington District of Columbia is known for its 22-karat gold leaf decorating the
                        ceiling and 46 statues of Roman soldiers. It is famous for its underground shopping concourse.
                        Because safety is a priority at Amtrak stations, the Amtrak Police keeps a close eye on all
                        activity in the terminals and on the trains. Philadelphia (30th St), Pennsylvania is famous
                        for its five-story wall windows and the glorious chandelier lighting. Union Terminal, Cincinnati
                        is recently transformed into Cincinnati Museum center. People travelling nearby Richmond will
                        witness the Main Street Station, Richmond’s six floor brick clocktower. Interior is a mimic of
                        an original Victorian-age building. In the future Amtrak aims to be the biggest and fastest transportation network 
                        in the US which will exceed the expectation of its customers.
